-- Rollback: Restore old tables (NOTE: This will require data migration from _v2 tables)
-- Migration 0009 Down: This is complex as it would require rebuilding denormalized data

-- NOTE: This rollback is provided for completeness but would require custom data migration
-- from the normalized _v2 tables back to the denormalized structure. 
-- In practice, this rollback should not be used without careful data migration planning.

-- This rollback would recreate the old table structures but would lose all data
-- A proper rollback would require rebuilding the denormalized data from the normalized tables

-- For safety, this down migration does nothing to prevent accidental data loss
-- If you need to rollback, you must manually recreate the old schema and migrate data

SELECT 'WARNING: This rollback requires manual data migration from normalized tables' as warning;
