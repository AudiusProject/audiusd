# audius core

The distributed event log that binds discovery, content, and identity together. The audius L1.

## architecture

Built with cometbft, audius core is the L1 blockchain that stores all the canon events in the audius protocol. The core is the library that allows you to build node types around this source, publish events, index data, and materialize views that then power audius applications.

```mermaid
graph TD
    L1["Audius L1"]
    L2a["Discovery Provider"]
    L2b["Content Node"]
    L2c["Identity Service"]

    L1 --> |"indexes discovery\n related data"| L2a
    L1 --> |"indexes content\n related data"| L2b
    L1 --> |"indexes identity\n related data"| L2c

```

## configuration

Whether running as an independent image or embedded, core requires some environment variables to run.

### local cluster
```
make install-deps
modd
```

### running in production


## testing

To run tests, ensure [audius dev tooling](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/blob/main/dev-tools/README.md) has been properly setup, then simply run 

```bash
audius-compose test run core
```

### unit tests

Place unit tests next to appropriate files in the standard go fashion

```bash
pkg/core/signature.go
pkg/core/signature_test.go
```

### integration tests

Integration tests are written with [ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) and [gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) to be more readable, the way to generate one is to use the ginkgo cli installed in the `make deps` command.

```bash
ginkgo generate NewTestName
```
